·这是游戏“哈利波特魔法觉醒”的赛季转盘抽奖规则。
·初始有四个大奖和若干小奖（详细数据见代码中的dictionary），清空一个大奖，其对应概率平分给剩余大奖；清空某样小奖，其所对应的概率，1%平分给剩余大奖，其余分给剩余小奖（如某样奖励
概率为16%，清空后，15%分给剩余的小奖，1%分给剩余大奖）
·本代码将预测所有大奖在多少抽数的时候抽中的概率（精度可通过总实验次数调整），并将结果绘制成折线图。

***English Description***
·This is the season spinner lottery rules for the game "Harry Potter: Magic Awakened".
·Initially, there are four grand prizes and several smaller prizes (see the dictionary in the code for detailed data). Once a grand prize is claimed, 
its probability is evenly distributed among the remaining grand prizes; when a specific small prize is claimed, its corresponding probability, 1% is 
evenly distributed among the remaining grand prizes, and the rest is distributed among the remaining small prizes (e.g., if a prize has a 16% probability, 
after it's claimed, 15% is distributed among the remaining small prizes, 1% among the remaining grand prizes).
·This code predicts the probability of drawing all grand prizes at a certain number of attempts (the precision can be adjusted by the total number of 
experiments), and the results are plotted as a line graph.

·If you also play similar games, I hope you find this enjoyable :)
